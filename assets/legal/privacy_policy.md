# Privacy Policy — Opperator AI Messages

**Effective Date: Oct, 2025**

## 1. Overview

At Opperator AI FZCO, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data when you or your customers use Opperator AI Messages ("Service").

Our Service powers AI-based conversations between Business Clients and End-Users via platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Business Clients are the data controllers** — they decide how your data is used.
- **Opperator AI is a data processor** — we process data only on behalf of Business Clients.
- **Compliance** — Our Service fully complies with Meta’s Platform Terms and Data Use Policy.

We process data based on:

- **Legitimate interest** (to operate and improve the Service)
- **Contractual necessity** (to provide requested services)
- **Consent**, where required

## 3. Data We Collect

When you interact through our Service, we may process:

### From Meta Platforms

- Name, language, timezone, and public profile data
- Facebook or Instagram user IDs
- Message content and timestamps
- Conversation duration and patterns

### System-Generated Data

- Session and log data for technical operations
- Anonymized analytics and error logs

We do not collect sensitive personal data unless explicitly provided and necessary for business communication.

## 4. How We Use Data

We use data to:

- Deliver AI-generated responses and manage conversations
- Help businesses provide support, schedule meetings, or share product info
- Maintain conversation continuity
- Improve service quality through aggregated analytics

All processing follows privacy-by-design principles — we minimize and tokenize data before AI processing whenever possible. We never sell or use personal data for advertising.

## 5. Information Sharing

We may share limited data with:

- **Business Clients**: to help them manage their customer communications
- **AI Model Providers**: such as Google (Gemini) and Anthropic (Claude), with personal data anonymized
- **Regulatory Authorities**: only when required by law

EU data is stored and processed within the EU. Non-EU data may be processed in other regions under proper safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

- Data is kept for 90 days after your last interaction.
- It is deleted earlier upon Business Client or user request.
- Minor-related data is deleted within 24–48 hours.
- After retention, data is anonymized for limited analytical use.
- Once anonymized, it cannot be linked back to any individual.

## 7. Data Security

We use strong security measures:

- End-to-end encryption (in transit and at rest)
- Access control and secure authentication
- Regular audits and system reviews

In case of a breach, Business Clients and regulators are notified within 24 hours as required by law.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access or receive a copy of your data
- Correct or delete inaccurate data
- Restrict or object to processing
- Withdraw consent
- Request data portability

How to exercise your rights:

- Contact the Business Client (data controller) first.
- If needed, contact us at privacy@opperator.ai for technical assistance. We respond within 30 days and may verify identity before fulfilling requests.
- You may also file a complaint with your local data protection authority.

## 9. Protection of Minors

Our Service is not intended for users under 16. If we detect underage interactions, we flag and delete related data within 24–48 hours and alert the relevant Business Client.

## 10. Automated Decision-Making

AI automation is limited to conversation assistance and does not make legally or financially significant decisions. Important actions always involve human review.

## 11. Cookies and Tracking

We currently do not use cookies or tracking tools on our own domains. All tracking on Meta platforms is governed by Meta’s own policies.

If tracking is introduced in the future, this Policy will be updated, and users will be notified.
